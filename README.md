## Problem
Predicting if a Blood Donor will donate within a given time window?

### Application
By solving this problem the blood donation camps can get 40% more blood donors.



### Code Requirements
The example code is in Python ([version 3.6.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-366/) or higher will work). 

### Dependencies

1) import pandas
2) import numpy
3) import seaborn
4) import matplotlib
5) import Counter
6) import sklearn

## Description

Use Python to explore data related to blood donors and we want to predict whether or not a donor will give blood the next time when the blood donation will be organised.

* This process will be done using a Jupyter Notebook.
* The code should run w/o errors.
* Appropriate use of
    * data structures/types
    * loops/conditional statements
    * Packages
    * functions
    * coding practices (i.e. Docstrings, comments, variable names & general
      readability)
* Analysis
    * Pose questions about the data
    * Inspect the structure of the original data (very important)
    * Clean the data
    * Answer questions about the data using descriptive statistics
    * Visualize the data (using plt and seaborn)
    * Perform additional exploratory analysis
    * Consider where data analysis can be applied to other fields.
* Feature Engineering
    * Using domain knowledge of the data to create features that make machine learning algorithms work. 
* Machine Learning
    * Use of Random Forest, Extra Trees, Gradient Boosting, SVC classifiers.

## File Descriptions

* ./data/ contains the various datasets.
* ./Blood Donation Prediction.ipynb is a Jupyter notebook containing the work I have done.
